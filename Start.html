            <p>Curiosity has led you and your friends to the entrance of this mysterious castle. As you step inside, the heavy metal door clangs shut behind you, sealing your fate. The air is thick with an eerie stillness, and the only illumination comes from the faint glow of forgotten experiments.
            A voice echoes through the chamber,"Welcome, intrepid adventurers, to the Castle of the Damned. You now find yourselves part of a grand fest. To escape, you must unravel the mysteries hidden within these walls. But beware, time is not your ally."
            The room you stand in is filled with peculiar contraptions, cryptic symbols, and locked cabinets. A large clock on the wall ominously ticks away, marking the minutes that stand between you and freedom. The only exit is secured by a series of intricate locks, each undoubtedly holding a piece of the puzzle.
            Can you unlock the secrets, decipher the codes, and escape the clutches of Bellatrix Lestrange's enigmatic fest before time runs out? The countdown begins. The escape game has commenced.
